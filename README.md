INSTRUCTIONS: One player, using their mouse, must defuse all modules on the bomb in front of them. A second player, using the guide at http://www.bombmanual.com/manual/1/html/index.html must instruct them on what to do to defuse the modules. The player looking at the screen is forbidden from looking at the manual, and vice-versa. This build only has three modules- wires, buttons and keypads.

References: Most understanding for using Pygame functions comes from the following websites and their examples:
http://thepythongamebook.com/en:pygame:start
http://www.pygame.org/docs/

Although I frequently copied function commands from here, like how to load a sprite, or detect mouse collision, each individual class and function is my own creation based on these directions.
